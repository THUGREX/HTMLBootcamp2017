## What is coding?
**Coding**, also know as **computer programming**, is just writing a set of instructions, or commands, that a computer will follow so you can get it to do what you want to do.

For example, let's say that we want to tell our computer to create a website for us with the words _Hello World!_ in blue. How would we do this? We can't just type `Please create a web page with the words Hello World in blue"`. We need to give the computer instructions which we call **code**.

How do we write code? Computers only understand code written in a **language**. For example, if we wanted to create the website we talked about above, we would write:
```html
<h1 style="color: blue;">Hello World!</h1>
```
The resulting website would look like this:

If the code above looks scary and complicated, don't panic! The `h1` in the code means to make the text _Hello World!_ really big. You can also see the words `color: blue`, which must have something to do with making the text look blue! If you still don't understand don't worry, we will get in more detail later!

The language the code is written in is **HTML** and **CSS**. These are the languages we will be learning throughout these 7 weeks in our bootcamp.

Coding is great because we can get computers to do things very quickly that us humans cannot. However, unlike us humans, computers can only understand code if we write it _exactly_ the way the language tells us to. For example, u cn stll undrstnd ths, even if it is not proper English. But if we tell the computer this:
```html
<h1 style="color: blue;">Hello World!<h1>
```
You will see nothing on the website because the last `/` was missing! Coding can be frustrating because of these small little things, but it's worth it cause we can do a lot of cool stuff like build cool looking websites or fun games!

## Why learn coding?
With coding we can learn to build cool things like games! For example, the game Angry Birds is written using HTML and CSS, the language you will be learning!

With coding we can also build big websites that other people around the world can use! For example, Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook, which 1 billion people use and now he is a billionaire!

For our final project, you will be building a social media website just like Facebook!

## What is Web Development?
In order to make cool website, we need to write code in HTML and CSS. But what is HTML and CSS?

Let's think of building a website like building a house! To build a house, we need to build the walls and roof. This is similar to HTML. HTML lets us put the text on the website. But just like a house without furniture, carpets or the walls painted, only HTML on a website looks boring. For example, this is how Facebook looks with only HTML:

It looks very boring and unrecognizable! This is where CSS comes in! CSS is similar to all the furniture and carpets that we add to our house to make it look pretty! With CSS, we can make the page we see above look like how you normally see Facebook when you login!

There is also a third important language to make cool websites called **Javascript**. This is similar to all the appliances like the stove, furnace, toilets, etc. Javascript helps our website do cool things. Unfortunately, we will not have time to learn Javascript, but I encourage you to learn it on your own time after our bootcamp is over because you will need it if you want to build cool games like Angry Birds!
