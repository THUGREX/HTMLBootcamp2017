Hello Class! I hope you are enjoying our weekly lessons! Here is the place where you will find all of the resources you need to do well in this bootcamp. Below you will learn:
  * Final project assignment sheet
  * How to find all of the code we wrote together in class
  * Class Notes
  * How to get help on coding problems when working at home
  * How to contact me

## Getting each week's code  
You can find all of the code we wrote together in class on this website. Just click on the file named `index.html` above:

Here you can see the code we wrote so far and copy and paste it on your Thimble and change it as you want.

Also, if you missed a week of lessons, you can click the Branch button and select which week you missed, then click on the `index.html` file:

The code in this file is the code we wrote up to that week. This is helpful if you missed a week and want to catch up.

You can also view that week's lesson notes by clicking on the file `Lesson.md`. This gives a detailed review of what we did during that lesson.

## Class Notes
You can find all of the class notes from each week's lesson by clicking the Wiki Tab above:

Here you will find an depth notes for each lesson.

## Help when working from home
I strongly encourage you to practise coding at home during the week by looking through the resources I have shown you and trying out your own projects or ideas. Two hours of coding a week may not be enough for you to full understand HTML and CSS!

If you are working on your own website, practising on some problems or working on the final project and get stuck and need some help, you can ask a question by clicking on the Issues tab above:

![](/screenshots/ReadMe/Issues.png)

Click the `New Issue` button to create an issue. Create a title describing the issue. Let's say you are wondering why the following block of code is not showing "Hello World!" on your website:
```html
<h1>Hello World!<h1>
```
Place your code in as such and describe the problem you are facing:

![](/screenshots/ReadMe/CreateIssue.png)

Then click Submit new issue. I will try to respond as soon as possible. To see if I have responded, click Issues, click on the Issue you created (in this case you would look for an issue called 'Can't see "Hello World" on my website).

## Contact
Please feel free to contact me through email if you have any questions or concerns! My email is `dexter.rivera@mail.utoronto.ca`. I will try to respond as soon as possible!
