Welcome to the coding olympics! The rules are simple:
1. I will give you a question and your team has to work together to try and figure out the answer
2. Once you get the answer, you need to put your hand up. I will come over and see if the answer is correct. If it is, you get points
3. Whoever answers the question correctly first gets the points. Harder questions earn more points
4. Your team will sometimes also have to come up and show the class how you did the answer to get the points!
5. You must work with your team to come up with the solution to the answer!

## Getting Started
Once you are in your teams, one of you must sign in to Thimble. Once on thimble, create a new project.

Then go to [](), press the `Clone or download` button and click `Download ZIP`.

Then go back to Thimble and click the green button right beside `FILES`. Click `Upload a file` and then press `From your computer ...`. Find the file you just downloaded. If you can't find it, put your hand up and I will help you find it. Now you have all of the different challenges and you are ready to get started!
